## React Native dating app

Dating app made with React Native and MobX based on a custom private API.

## How to run

Although it is not possible to run this project on a local environment without access to the API, you can modify the `Api.js` file to return hard-coded values instead of API generated ones. After that, do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/cannblw/dating-app
cd dating-app
npm i
npm start
```

## Note

This project is currently in development. Althought it will run at any time, the application lacks many of its expected functionality.
